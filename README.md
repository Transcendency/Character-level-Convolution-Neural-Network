# Character level word embedding
Character-level Convoution Neural Network is a class project. Based on word2vec, indead treat each word as one atomic entity, use convolution kernel to scan each word, and feed the feature of each work to a single layer feed forward neural network. The model was able to learn structurally similar words.
